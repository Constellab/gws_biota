Introduction
============

Biota provides web services access to a collection of high-quality biological data extracted for public database.

Ontology databses
=================

This is as collection of open ontology databases such as GO, SBO, BTO, etc. This collection is designed to improve the interpretation of Gencovery digital organisms. Because Gencovery philosopy is to encourage and preserve open innovation, collected databases remain freely accessible (i.e. without any supplementary fees) under the original licenses. 

Genen Ontology (GO)
-------------------

The Gene Ontology (GO) knowledgebase is the world’s largest source of information on the functions of genes. This knowledge is both human-readable and machine-readable, and is a foundation for computational analysis of large-scale molecular biology and genetics experiments in biomedical research.

Gene Ontology Consortium data and data products are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Unported License.

Systems Biology Ontology (SBO)
------------------------------

The Systems Biology Ontology is a set of controlled, relational vocabularies of terms commonly used in Systems Biology, and in particular in computational modelling. It consists of seven orthogonal vocabularies defining: reaction participants roles (e.g. "substrate"), quantitative parameters (e.g. "Michaelis constant"), classification of mathematical expressions describing the system (e.g. "mass action rate law"), modelling framework used (e.g. "logical framework"), the nature of the entity (e.g. "macromolecule"), the type of interaction (e.g. "process"), as well as a branch to define the different types of metadata that may be present within a model.

The BRENDA Tissue Ontology (BTO)
--------------------------------

A structured controlled vocabulary for the source of an enzyme comprising tissues, cell lines, cell types and cell cultures.

Evidence and Conclusion Ontology (ECO)
--------------------------------------

The Evidence & Conclusion Ontology (ECO) describes types of scientific evidence within the biological research domain that arise from laboratory experiments, computational methods, literature curation, or other means.

ECO (https://github.com/evidenceontology/evidenceontology) is released into the public domain under CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0). Official website: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/eco

NCBI Taxonomy
-------------

The Taxonomy Database is a curated classification and nomenclature for all of the organisms in the public sequence databases. This currently represents about 10% of the described species of life on the planet.

Molecular databases
===================

This is as collection of open molecular databases such as BRENDA, CheBI, Uniprot, etc. This collection is designed to improve the conception and interpretation of Gencovery digital organisms. Because Gencovery philosopy is to encourage and preserve open innovation, collected databases remain freely accessible (i.e. without any supplementary fees) under the original licenses. 

Enzyme Database - BRENDA
------------------------

BRENDA (The Comprehensive Enzyme Information System) is an information system representing one of the most comprehensive enzyme repositories.

ChEBI 
-----

Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) is a freely available dictionary of molecular entities focused on small chemical compounds. 

Official website: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi

All data in the ChEBI database is non-proprietary or is derived from a non-proprietary source. It is thus freely accessible and available to anyone. In addition, each data item is fully traceable and explicitly referenced to the original source.
The data are available under the Creative Commons License (CC BY 4.0).

Rhea
----

Rhea is an expert-curated knowledgebase of chemical and transport reactions of biological interest - and the standard for enzyme and transporter annotation in UniProtKB. Rhea uses the chemical dictionary ChEBI (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest) to describe reaction participants

Uniprot 
-------

The Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) is a comprehensive resource for protein sequence and annotation data. The UniProt databases are the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB), the UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef), and the UniProt Archive (UniParc). The UniProt consortium and host institutions EMBL-EBI, SIB and PIR are committed to the long-term preservation of the UniProt databases. Official website: https://www.uniprot.org.
