property_value: IAO:0000112 "The 10 previously identified GlnR-regulated genes were all confirmed to be under GlnR control during nitrogen stress (i.e. differential expression in the wild type compared to the DeltaglnR mutant), but in addition a total of 392 genes were significantly up-regulated and 291 significantly down regulated (Additional file 1: Table S1). This indicates that GlnR mediates (directly or indirectly) the expression of over 680 genes." xsd:string {xref="PMID:23642041"}

comment: Note that mutations need not be negative.  Changes to DNA sequence (mutations) may be detrimental, have no impact, or be beneficial.
comment: The allele that encodes the phenotype most common in a particular natural population is referred to as the wild type allele, while any other form of that allele is known as the mutant form.

comment: Typically enzymes which confer resistance to antibiotics, such as Dihydrofolate reductase or Beta-lactamase, or proteins that give colorimetric or fluorescent signals are used. The Bait protein is generally the protein under study and the methods are readily adaptable to highthroughput mode.
