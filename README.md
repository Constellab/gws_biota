# 👋 Welcome to GWS Biota

```gws_biota``` is a [Constellab](https://constellab.io) library (called bricks) developped by [Gencovery](https://gencovery.com/). GWS stands for Gencovery Web Services.

## 🚀 What is Constellab?


✨ [Gencovery](https://gencovery.com/) is a software company that offers [Constellab](https://constellab.io)., the leading open and secure digital infrastructure designed to consolidate data and unlock its full potential in the life sciences industry. Gencovery's mission is to provide universal access to data to enhance people's health and well-being.

🌍 With our Fair Open Access offer, you can use Constellab for free. [Sign up here](https://constellab.space/). Find more information about the Open Access offer here (link to be defined).


## ✅ Features

Biota is a unified and structured collection of omics data from official open European biological databases.
It is dedicated to Gencovery Web Services for the conception and use of digital twins of cell metabolism.
- A curated reference database of compounds, enzymes, reactions, proteins, pathways, taxonomy and organisms, plus the GO, SBO, ECO and BTO ontologies (see [ENTITIES_OVERVIEW.md](./ENTITIES_OVERVIEW.md))
- Download and manage the Biota reference database (Biota DB Downloader / Zipper)
- ETL tasks to build and enrich the database: create enzyme and reaction records, extract NCBI proteome/data, retrieve kcat values, map EC numbers to BiGG model identifiers, build kcat contextualization files
- Unicell: build a whole-cell reaction network graph for an organism, used notably by `gws_gem` to reconstruct draft genome-scale metabolic models
- Generate a Bio Navigator app to explore the Biota database interactively, with an integrated AI chat assistant (Ask Biota)

## 🛠️ Installation

The `gws_biota` brick requires the `gws_core` and `gws_ai_toolkit` bricks.

### 🔥 Recommended Method

The best way to install a brick is through the Constellab platform. With our Fair Open Access offer, you get a free cloud data lab where you can install bricks directly. [Sign up here](https://constellab.space/)

Learn about the data lab here : [Overview](https://constellab.community/bricks/gws_academy/latest/doc/digital-lab/overview/294e86b4-ce9a-4c56-b34e-61c9a9a8260d) and [Data lab management](https://constellab.community/bricks/gws_academy/latest/doc/digital-lab/on-cloud-digital-lab-management/4ab03b1f-a96d-4d7a-a733-ad1edf4fb53c)

### 🔧 Manual installation

This section is for users who want to install the brick manually. It can also be used to install the brick manually in the Constellab Codelab.

We recommend installing using Ubuntu 22.04 with python 3.10.

Required packages are listed in the ```settings.json``` file, for now the packages must be installed manually.

```bash
pip install biopython==1.79 networkx==3.4.2 pronto==2.5.7 pyparsing==3.0.6
pip install git+https://github.com/Constellab/brendapy.git
```

#### Usage


▶️ To start the server :

```bash
gws server run
```

🕵️ To run a given unit test

```bash
gws server test [TEST_FILE_NAME]
```

Replace `[TEST_FILE_NAME]` with the name of the test file (without `.py`) in the tests folder. Execute this command in the folder of the brick.

🕵️ To run the whole test suite, use the following command:

```bash
gws server test all
```

📌 VSCode users can use the predefined run configuration in `.vscode/launch.json`.
